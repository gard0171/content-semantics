   <p>55 to 65 days are needed from germination to harvest of the root.</p>
   <p>The usually deep purple roots of beetroot are eaten either grilled, boiled, or roasted as a cooked vegetable, cold as a salad after cooking and adding oil and vinegar, or raw and shredded, either alone or combined with any salad vegetable.</p>
   <p>In fact, <cite>Jim Halpert</cite> once said this about beets, <q>“Fact, bears eat beets. Bears, beets, Battlestar Galactica”</q>.</p>
   <blockquote>
     <p>I have some weird habits. For instance, I love beets. Show me a salad bar and I will clean them out of their beets.</p>
